copy the mpv folder to your etc directory. 
or, copy the files inside this mpv folder to your etc/mpv directory.
unzip the fonts in the same directory
Don't use the flatpak version. This is not the directory for the flatpak version.
etc/mpv is not the directory for the flatpak version. 
I don't even know where the directory for flatpak version exactly is.
But if you find it, you can copy the files inside this mpv folder to the flatpak directory.
Have fun.
